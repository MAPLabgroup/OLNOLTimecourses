function [ ] = generate_conditionlabels_forpatterns(S)
%This script is a shortened script adapted from "TIB_generate_beta_filenames"
% in the plMVPA toolbox
% It generates indices and lists of "betas" or other patterns if you aren't 
% using "raw" bold data (i.e., if you are doing existpatmat or betas in the
% plMVPA pipeline) to be used for MVPA analysis using PM_run_mvpa_general
%
% % "names" MUST be edited to match those of the target condition names 
%  identified in your "_params" file. Order must also be the same.
%
%FOR BINARY CLASSIFICATION: assign condition index for 1st + 2nd classes to
%"betaidx{1,1}" + "betaidx{1,2}" - as opposed to whatever cell they might normally be
%associated with (i.e., if you are classifying between classes 2 and 5, we
%don't want to store the indices in cells 2 and 5 for binary.



% load in onsets and regs
onsetsmat = [S.mvpa_dir S.onsets_filename];
load(onsetsmat);

%% if we are doing x-validation classification (the most common case)
if strcmp(S.trainTask,S.testTask) 
    %set up a beta index file (equivalent to the onsets element of a normal
    %model file). ***IMPORTANT***If you look at the index numbers this 
    % generates, they should make sense in light of the original model 
    % files for your study - e.g. if there were 29 goal_1 onsets, we
    %should have 29 1s in the goal_1 idx cell
