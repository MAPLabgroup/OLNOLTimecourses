% Created for Estibaliz's OLNOL timecourse reanalysis

% NOTE: for simplicity, this version is set up JUST for existpatmat data

% NOTE: you MUST edit the condition names every time you change your

% generate_conditionlabels_forpatterns(S) script - otherwise it will fail

% %example call, existmatmat (timecourses early/late)- TIB_run_mvpa_general({'02'},'OLNOLTimecourses',{[960]},'8080test')
% example call(all trials), existpatmat - TIB_run_mvpa_general({'01'},'OLNOLTimecourses',{[480]},'8080test')
% this call is NOT run from this function. It is given to
% TIB_run_mvpa_general.m!!!

% establish parameters for mvpa analysis
% <subj_id> - identifier for the given subject. Can be numerical or a
% string
% <task> 'goals' or 'plan'
%
% Study paths, scan parameters, and subject parameters are set up here for
% the analysis in several dat structures (e.g., S.xX; par.xX)

% Important - 09/2018 - existpatmat scenario has a variety of quirks and
% hardcodes. If using this function, check the comments and relevant
% scripts to ensure proper use

% Most variables are assigned to either par or S. At this time, it's not well
% organized what info goes into what.

%% EDIT - You must establish these general parameters

% ~~~ WHAT IS YOUR *Study name* (code looks for this specific folder) ~~~
S.exp_name = 'OLNOLTimecourses'; %change this to flexibly redirect the script to different studies in subdirectories

% ~~~ WHAT IS YOUR *subject ID/number PREFIX* (code appends this to the
% front of the sub number provided with the run_mvpa_general function call)
subprefix = 'Featset';

% ~~~ DO YOU WANT *to read in a .mat file with existing patterns in it
% already (instead of fMRI image files)?
S.existpatmat = 1; %1=yes - skip trying to load image files using SPM. We've already got all patterns in a matrix. Currently (09/2018) the existing pattern matrix is hardcoded in load_matrix_pattern_2D to be a matrix (double) named 'testmat'. \\
% Because so much of the Princeton MVPA toolbox assumes a mask volume is used, a dummy mask file is now included in the PLMVPA_Lite toolkit and called in TIB_run_MVPA_general
% What's that existing pattern .mat file called?
S.datafile = ['FeatSet_' subj_id{1} '.mat']; % Replaces default function involving 3D/4D MRI image (e.g., nii) files with an existing matrix of pattern data (e.g., eeg, timecourse extractions, behavior patterns)

% ~~~ HOW MANY *single patterns* are there? If data input type is 'raw', number is not used (can be ignored)
S.stbetacount = 480; % NOTE: the code assumes all single trial betas of potential interest are contiguous in the model. If multi-event betas are inteleaved in the .mat model structure, this will need more editing.
%S.stbetacount = 960; % NOTE: I'd be 960 instead of 480 if would've
%analyzed 'NEW' plus "OLD"
% ~~~ WHAT IS YOUR *scan TR in the units of your model file (usually seconds)*
% NOTE: if working with Betas or existing pattern matrix - if your "onsets" file is really a numerical list of beta numbers instead of onsets, you must set TR = 1.
% If your onsets file is in seconds, set this as the TR ***even for Betas***.
par.TR = 1;

% ~~~ DO YOU WANT *to read in an existing extracted workspace (e.g., BOLD
% patterns). Not the same as having a simple pre-defined matrix ready for
% classification with one column per pattern (see existpatmat flag on next line)
S.use_premade_workspace = 0;


%% IGNORE - unused for this study (but referenced in other versions of the code)
% ~~~ WHAT ARE YOUR *image dimensions* (4D or 3D files?)
% As of 12/31/17, code only supports 3D images.
% It is planned to support use 4D nifti files for raw BOLD data ('4').
% If you have split them out into TR-by-TR, enter '3'
%par.ImgDims = 3;

% ~~~ DO YOU WANT *to read in the BOLD image file names on-the-fly or do you
% have an existing list of image names? On-the-fly adds a little time; but
% if you have it off, and make a change to the images, do must update your
% image list file... otherwise you'll run the old classification problem
% again
%par.readimglist = 0; %1=yes, read an existing list; 0 = no, generate on the fly please (slower but recommended).
